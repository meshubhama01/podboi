# podboi

A simple podcast app made in flutter that aims to just get the work done easily and beautifully.

# Info:
This is a dev branch, I test things, move stuff around or just replace things entirely sometimes. I only push the changes I'm finally with and most probably won't change in near future.


# Dev Screenshot (Progress):
